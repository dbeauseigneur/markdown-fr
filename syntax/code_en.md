The blocks of pre-formated codes are used to write on the programming or highlight source code. More than of simple paragraph, the lines of code of a block of code are literally interpreted.

Here's an example :

```
This is a block of code
```

For example:

```
This is a normal paragraphe:

    This is a block of code.
```

you can also create a block of code separated with: 

    ```

For example:

    This is `an inline block of code'

### Highlight of the syntax 

You can define the language used to highlight the syntax by adding a name on an opening keyword. Example : 

    ```js
    var a = {};
    ```
